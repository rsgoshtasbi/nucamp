# nucamp

### Clone to your computer
- In terminal(mac) or command prompt(windows), go to your Nucamp folder > bootstrap.
  - Ex: Should be like cd NucampFolder/2-Bootstrap
- copy this command: `git clone https://github.com/rsgoshtasbi/nucamp.git`
  - This will clone the repo to your computer.
- Then run the following based on who you are lol
  - Frank: `git checkout -b frank`
  - Mia: `git checkout -b mia`
  - This will create a branch for you to work off seperately. That way we all have a copy of the base code. Then you can each work on your specific parts and push your code changes without interferring with each other. I will go ahead and merge it all throughout the week so that it's a less complicated thing for you guys to worry about :)

- To push updates to branch and to set upstream on your first push use $ git push -u origin BRANCHNAME
  - Frank: 'git push -u origin frank'
  - Mia: 'git push -u origin mia'
  - Apparently you do not need the -u orgin BRANCHNAME once the upstream is set. You can just use 'git push' like normal.
